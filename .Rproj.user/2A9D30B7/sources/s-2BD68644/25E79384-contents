Version: 1.0.0
Author: David Harvey
Maintainer: David Harvey <harvey@depauw.edu>
Description: The functions in this package simulate cyclic voltammetry, 
    linear-sweep voltammetry (both with and without stirring of the 
    solution), and single-pulse and double-pulse chronoamperometry 
    and chronocoulometry experiments using the method outlined in 
    Gosser, D. K. Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation and Analysis of 
    Reaction Mechanisms, VCH, New York, 1993 and inBrown, J. H., 
    J. Chem. Educ., 2015, 92, 1490-1496. Additional functions provide 
    ways to display and to examine the results of these simulations.
    The primary purpose of this package is to provide tools for
    use in courses in analytical chemistry.
